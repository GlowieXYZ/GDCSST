<h3>About</h3>
<p>DCS Server Tracker (DCST) is a tool that allows you to keep track of <a href="https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/">DCS World</a> online servers. It tracks the servers, the number of players and which scenarios are played on them and tries to present all the information gathered in something that is easy to see at a glance.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>This site features the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An up to to date list of DCS Servers (kindly provided by digitalcombatsimulator.com)</li>
  <li>Sorting functions</li>
  <li>Per server graph of recently active players along with additional information</li>
  <li>Providing tools for the community like server info in JSON or a Prometheus exporter (See the Tech section)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tech</h3>
<h4>Tools used</h4>
<p>GDCSST is made using the following tools:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom Editor</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/lomik/prometheus-png/">Prometheus-PNG</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">AWS CloudFront</a> (Which as a pain to setup the first time)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>JSON data of servers</h4>
  <p>This site offers the ability to get server data as stored in Redis in JSON format. This is achieved by setting the "Accept" header to "application/json" as so:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>curl -H "accept: application/json" https://dcs.glowie.xyz/servers/136.243.51.111:10300</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is setup to allow your script or discord-bot to collect metrics on your server without having to hammer the DCS servers and go through all the hoops. Hope it helps.</p>
  <h4>Prometheus Exporter</h4>
  <p>This service also provides a public Prometheus exporter for use. The URL is <a href="https://dcs.glowie.xyz/metrics">https://dcs.glowie.xyz/metrics</a>. This allows you to collect your own data and create nice graphs than I ever can.</p>
  <h4>GitHub repo</h4>
  <p>Questions? Bugs? Contribute? Run your own instance? <a href="https://github.com/GlowieXYZ/GDCSST/">Check this out at GitHub.</a></p>
  <h4>TODO</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Add nice server filters (need Javascript skills for that)</li>
    <li>Have a dedicated server detector running.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Changelog</h3>
<h4>2021-10-19: Rewrite in Go</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Finally got the time to rewrite this application in Go and use tech that allows it to continue for extended periods of time without my intervention. I am so lazy, so if I get this right I shouldn't have to bother unless the monitoring starts alerting me. :-)</li>
</ul>
<h4>2019-09-16: Improving one line at the time!</h4>
<ul>
  <li>MySQL queries go through redis now to improve query speed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2019-09-15: Lets try again..</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Replaced DynamoDB and memcached in favour of redis.</li>
  <li>Dumped all the MySQL related queries into a function. Makes it SLOW AF. But should cause less trouble in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2019-03-16: I needed a global CDN for this?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Show country-flags of where the servers are hosted.</li>
  <li>Cached IP->Country results into memcached</li>
</ul>
<h4>2019-03-15: The great "What is sleep?" rewrite!</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Rewrote and relaunched the application</b></li>
  <li>Moved server-data to MySQL from DynamoDB</li>
  <li>Moved session-data to MySQL for later processing</li>
  <li>Moved player-data to MySQL for later processing</li>
</ul>
