# GDCSST
Digital Combat Simulator Server Tracker written in Go

## About
The goal of GDCSST is to capture server information from the [DCS](digitalcombatsimulator.com/) website, store and visualize it into a human readable format.

## Requirements
To run this use any recent versions of the following:
- [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
- [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (Probably [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) too, but haven't tested it.)

## Installation
1. Setup a Redis server (or Cluster)
2. Setup Prometheus2PNG
3. Be not tired...
